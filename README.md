# binarycpu

Identify the processor architecture of binary files.

## Usage

### On the command line

Simply install with `npm install -g binarycpu` and then call this with the path you wish to scan. e.g.

```bash
binarycpu c:\apps
```

And it will print out the file names of identified PE/MZ binary files with their appropriate cpu architecture (see table below).

### In your own code

```javascript
const binarycpu = require('binarycpu')

const arch = binarycpu.determinePEArch(filename)
```

`null` is returned if the file is not a MZ/PE file.  If the processor architecture is unknown it will return unknown as well as the hex identifier.

## Possible architectures

These have been kept the same as the Microsoft docs for PE files.

## Notes

* Only Portable Executable files are supported (ELF, mach-O could be added later)
* Errors are thrown if it is a MZ file but it can't find the PE signature
